MineSweeperTheory - MineCon.py
==============================

This concept is built on Microsofts minesweeper game created by Curtis Johnson.
Create a random grid consisting of '0's for blank spaces and '*'s for mines.
The program, written in Python 3, will replace the 0s with the number of mines around them.
