MineSweeperTheory - MineCon.py
==============================

This concept is built on Microsofts minesweeper game created by Curtis Johnson.
Create a random grid consisting of '0's for blank spaces and '*'s for mines.
The program will replace the 0s with the number of mines around them.

This was an exercise at Cyber-Dojo https://goo.gl/AEnNrW given by JR Rickerson, host of PyAtl's Jam Session on 7/7/16.
The code is written in Python 3, if you wish to run it on Python 2.7+, change input to raw_input.
Run MineCon.py to see for yourself,
criticism appreciated.
